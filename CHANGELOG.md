<ul>
<li>My initial commit of my Pokedex project, Project 0.
<li>The second commit is the same as the first, so I could commit and push to GitHub.
<li>The third commit is for the same day, and I fleshed out the server to<br>
get it reading the CSV file, and printing the whole file or printing the<br>
singular Pok&eacute;mon entered into the URL.
